    <field content="Abstract：To evaluate the effect of premolar axial wall height on the retention of adhesive, full-coverage, computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) restorations.A total of 48 premolar teeth randomized into four groups (n = 12 per group) received all-ceramic CAD/CAM restorations with axial wall heights (AWH) of 3, 2, 1, and 0 mm and 16-degree total occlusal convergence (TOC). Specimens were restored with lithium disilicate material and cemented with self-adhesive resin cement. Specimens were loaded to failure after 24 hours.The 3- and 2-mm AWH specimens demonstrated significantly greater failure load. Failure analysis suggests a 2-mm minimum AWH for premolars with a TOC of 16 degrees.Adhesive technology may compensate for compromised AWH." />

    <field content="Abstract：We compared the incidence of hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y-Gastric-Bypass (RYGB) versus Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG).Randomized, open-label trial conducted at the outpatient obesity-clinic in a university-hospital in Rome, Italy. The primary aim was the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia (&lt;3.1 mmol/l after 75g-oral-glucose-load) at 1 year after surgery (intention-to-treat-analysis, carried-forward for missing data). Secondary aims were hypoglycemia under everyday-life conditions, insulin-sensitivity and insulin-secretion, lipid profile.Of 175 eligible patients, 120 were randomized 1:1 to RYGB or SG; 117 (93%) completed the 12-months follow-up. Hypoglycemia during oral-glucose-tolerance testing was detected in 14% and 29% of SG and RYGB patients (P=0.079), with the effect of treatment in multivariate analysis significant at P=0.018. Daily hypoglycemic episodes during continuous-glucose-monitoring did not differ between groups (P=0.75). Four out of 59 RYGB-subjects (6.8%) had 1-3 hospitalizations for symptomatic-hypoglycemia vs. 0 in SG. The static β-cell glucose-sensitivity-index, evaluated by minimal model, increased after both treatments (from 50.99±33.68∙109min-1 to 120.43±98.90∙109min-1, P&lt;0.001), but the dynamic β-cell glucose-sensitivity-index increased significantly in SG (from 323.93±480.87∙109 to 933.32±1063.86∙109min-1, P=0.008) and decreased in RYGB (from 645.69±733.21∙109 to 414.90±469.87∙109 min-1; P=0.004 for time×treatment interaction). Whole-body insulin-sensitivity increased about 10-fold in both groups. The higher the BMI reduction, the higher was the number of hypoglycemic episodes.We show that reactive-hypoglycemia is no less common after SG and this is not a safer option than RYGB, but RYGB is associated with more severe hypoglycemic episodes. This is likely due to the lack of improvement of β-cell sensitivity to changes in circulating glucose after RYGB, which determines an inappropriately high insulin-secretion in the face of a dramatically improved peripheral insulin-sensitivity." />

    <field content="Abstract：Creating large datasets for biomedical relation classification can be prohibitively expensive. While some datasets have been curated to extract protein-protein and drug-drug interactions from text, we are also interested in other interactions including gene-disease and chemical-protein connections. Also, many biomedical researchers have begun to explore ternary relationships. Even when annotated data is available, many datasets used for relation classification are inherently biased. For example, issues such as sample selection bias typically prevent models from generalizing in the wild. To address the problem of cross-corpora generalization, we present a novel adversarial learning algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation tasks where no labeled data is available in the target domain. Instead, our method takes advantage of unlabeled data to improve biased classifiers through learning domain-invariant features via an adversarial process. Finally, our method is built upon recent advances in neural network methods.We experiment by extracting protein-protein and drug-drug interactions from text. In our experiments, we show domain invariant features can be learned in neural networks such that classifiers trained for one interaction type (protein-protein) can be re-purposed to others (drug-drug). We also show that our method can adapt to different source and target pairs of protein-protein interaction datasets. Compared to prior convolutional and recurrent neural network based relation classification methods without domain adaptation, we achieve improvements as high as 30% in F1-score. Likewise, we show improvements over state-of-the-art adversarial methods.Experimental code is available at http://anthonyrios.net/other/adv_code.zip.Zhiyong.Lu@nih.gov.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online." />

    <field content="Abstract：Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate multiple omics data at an unprecedented rate and scale. The accumulation of these omics data far outpaces the rate at which biologists can mine and generate new hypothesis to test experimentally. There is an urgent need to develop a myriad of powerful tools to efficiently and effectively search and filter these resources to address specific post-GWAS functional genomics questions. However, to date, these resources are scattered across several databases and often lack a unified portal for data annotation and analytics. In addition, existing tools to analyze and visualize these databases are highly fragmented, resulting researchers to access multiple applications and manual interventions for each gene or variant in an ad hoc fashion until all the questions are answered.In this study, we present GENEASE, a web-based one-stop bioinformatics tool designed to not only query and explore multi-omics and phenotype databases (e.g., GTEx, ClinVar, dbGaP, GWAS Catalog, ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, KEGG, Reactome, Gene and Phenotype Ontology) in a single web interface but also to perform seamless post genome-wide association downstream functional and overlap analysis for non-coding regulatory variants. GENEASE accesses over 50 different databases in public domain including model organism-specific databases to facilitate gene/variant and disease exploration, enrichment and overlap analysis in real time. It is a user-friendly tool with point-and-click interface containing links for support information including user manual and examples.GENEASE can be accessed freely at http://research.cchmc.org/mershalab/genease_new/login.html.Tesfaye.Mersha@cchmc.org, Sudhir.Ghandikota@cchmc.org.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online." />

    <field content="Abstract：Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), natural components of innate immunity, are popular targets for developing new drugs. Machine learning methods are now commonly adopted by wet-laboratory researchers to screen for promising candidates.In this work we utilize deep learning to recognize antimicrobial activity. We propose a neural network model with convolutional and recurrent layers that leverage primary sequence composition. Results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art classification models on a comprehensive data set. By utilizing the embedding weights, we also present a reduced-alphabet representation and show that reasonable AMP recognition can be maintained using nine amino-acid types.Models and data sets are made freely available through the Antimicrobial Peptide Scanner vr.2 web server at: www.ampscanner.com.amarda@gmu.edu for general inquiries and dan.veltri@gmail.com for web server information.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online." />

    <field content="Abstract：The detection of genomic variants has great significance in genomics, bioinformatics and biomedical research and applications. However, despite a lot of effort, Indels and structural variants are still under-characterized compared to SNPs. Current approaches based on next-generation sequencing data usually require large numbers of reads (high coverage) to be able to detect such types of variants accurately. However Indels, especially those close to each other, are still hard to detect accurately.We introduce a novel approach that leverages known variant information, e.g. provided by dbSNP, dbVar, ExAC or the 1000 Genomes Project, to improve sensitivity of detecting variants, especially close-by Indels. In our approach, the standard reference genome and the known variants are combined to build a meta-reference, which is expected to be probabilistically close to the subject genomes than the standard reference. An alignment algorithm, which can take into account known variant information, is developed to accurately align reads to the meta-reference. This strategy resulted in accurate alignment and variant calling even with low coverage data. We showed that compared to popular methods such as GATK and SAMtools, our method significantly improved the sensitivity of detecting variants, especially Indels that are close to each other. In particular, our method was able to call these close-by Indels at a 15-20% higher sensitivity than other methods at low coverage, and still get 1-5% higher sensitivity at high coverage, at competitive precision. These results were validated using simulated data with variant profiles extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project data, and real data from the Illumina Platinum Genomes Project and ExAC database. Our finding suggests that by incorporating known variant information in an appropriate manner, sensitive variant calling is possible at a low cost.Implementation can be found in our public code repository https://github.com/namsyvo/IVC.nvo2@mdanderson.org.Supplementary material is enclosed with submission." />

    <field content="Abstract：Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37o). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates. A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion. MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine." />

    <field content="Abstract：Peer-to-peer lending is hypothesized to help equalize economic opportunities for the world's poor. We empirically investigate the &quot;flat-world&quot; hypothesis, the idea that globalization eventually leads to economic equality, using crowdfinancing data for over 660,000 loans in 220 nations and territories made between 2005 and 2013. Contrary to the flat-world hypothesis, we find that peer-to-peer lending networks are moving away from flatness. Furthermore, decreasing flatness is strongly associated with multiple variables: relatively stable patterns in the difference in the per capita GDP between borrowing and lending nations, ongoing migration flows from borrowing to lending nations worldwide, and the existence of a tie as a historic colonial. Our regression analysis also indicates a spatial preference in lending for geographically proximal borrowers. To estimate the robustness for these patterns for future changes, we construct a network of borrower and lending nations based on the observed data. Then, to perturb the network, we stochastically simulate policy and event shocks (e.g., erecting walls) or regulatory shocks (e.g., Brexit). The simulations project a drift towards rather than away from flatness. However, levels of flatness persist only for randomly distributed shocks. By contrast, loss of the top borrowing nations produces more flatness, not less, indicating how the welfare of the overall system is tied to a few distinctive and critical country-pair relationships." />

    <field content="Abstract：Upon a first encounter, individuals spontaneously associate faces with certain personality dimensions. Such first impressions can strongly impact judgments and decisions and may prove highly consequential. Researchers investigating the impact of facial information often rely on (a) real photographs that have been selected to vary on the dimension of interest, (b) morphed photographs, or (c) computer-generated faces (avatars). All three approaches have distinct advantages. Here we present the Basel Face Database, which combines these advantages. In particular, the Basel Face Database consists of real photographs that are subtly, but systematically manipulated to show variations in the perception of the Big Two and the Big Five personality dimensions. To this end, the information specific to each psychological dimension is isolated and modeled in new photographs. Two studies serve as systematic validation of the Basel Face Database. The Basel Face Database opens a new pathway for researchers across psychological disciplines to investigate effects of perceived personality." />

    <field content="Abstract：Co-inheritance of α-thalassemia has a significant protective effect on the severity of complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including stroke. However, little information exists on the association and interactions for the common African ancestral α-thalassemia mutation (-α3.7 deletion) and β-globin traits (HbS trait [SCT] and HbC trait) on important clinical phenotypes such as red blood cell parameters, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In a community-based cohort of 2,916 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study, we confirmed the expected associations between SCT, HbC trait, and the -α3.7 deletion with lower mean corpuscular volume/mean corpuscular hemoglobin and higher red blood cell count and red cell distribution width. In addition to the recently recognized association of SCT with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), we observed a novel association of the -α3.7 deletion with higher HbA1c levels. Co-inheritance of each additional copy of the -α3.7 deletion significantly lowered the risk of anemia and chronic kidney disease among individuals with SCT (P-interaction = 0.031 and 0.019, respectively). Furthermore, co-inheritance of a novel α-globin regulatory variant was associated with normalization of red cell parameters in individuals with the -α3.7 deletion and significantly negated the protective effect of α-thalassemia on stroke in 1,139 patients with sickle cell anemia from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) (P-interaction = 0.0049). Functional assays determined that rs11865131, located in the major alpha-globin enhancer MCS-R2, was the most likely causal variant. These findings suggest that common α- and β-globin variants interact to influence hematologic and clinical phenotypes in African Americans, with potential implications for risk-stratification and counseling of individuals with SCD and SCT." />

    <field content="Abstract：Majorana zero-modes-a type of localized quasiparticle-hold great promise for topological quantum computing. Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool for identifying the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak in differential conductance. The height of the Majorana zero-bias peak is predicted to be quantized at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature (where e is the charge of an electron and h is the Planck constant), as a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry in which a particle is its own antiparticle. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization against disorder, interactions and variations in the tunnel coupling. Previous experiments, however, have mostly shown zero-bias peaks much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent observation of a peak height close to 2e2/h. Here we report a quantized conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires covered with an aluminium superconducting shell. The height of our zero-bias peak remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic field and tunnel coupling, indicating that it is a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins by investigating its robustness to electric and magnetic fields as well as its temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau strongly supports the existence of Majorana zero-modes in the system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments that could lead to topological quantum computing." />

    <field content="Abstract：We investigated adapting the interaction style of intelligent tutoring system (ITS) feedback based on human-automation etiquette strategies.Most ITSs adapt the content difficulty level, adapt the feedback timing, or provide extra content when they detect cognitive or affective decrements. Our previous work demonstrated that changing the interaction style via different feedback etiquette strategies has differential effects on students' motivation, confidence, satisfaction, and performance. The best etiquette strategy was also determined by user frustration.Based on these findings, a rule set was developed that systemically selected the proper etiquette strategy to address one of four learning factors (motivation, confidence, satisfaction, and performance) under two different levels of user frustration. We explored whether etiquette strategy selection based on this rule set (systematic) or random changes in etiquette strategy for a given level of frustration affected the four learning factors. Participants solved mathematics problems under different frustration conditions with feedback that adapted dynamic changes in etiquette strategies either systematically or randomly.The results demonstrated that feedback with etiquette strategies chosen systematically via the rule set could selectively target and improve motivation, confidence, satisfaction, and performance more than changing etiquette strategies randomly. The systematic adaptation was effective no matter the level of frustration for the participant.If computer tutors can vary the interaction style to effectively mitigate negative emotions, then ITS designers would have one more mechanism in which to design affect-aware adaptations that provide the proper responses in situations where human emotions affect the ability to learn." />

    <field content="Abstract：The measurement of broadband ultrasound attenuation describes the linear increase in ultrasound attenuation with frequency (dB/MHz); this is generally performed at the calcaneus, consisting of a high proportion of metabolically active cancellous bone. Although broadband ultrasound attenuation is not routinely implemented within clinical management since it cannot provide a reliable estimation of bone mineral density and hence clinical definition of osteopenia and osteoporosis, it offers a reliable means to predict osteoporotic fracture risk. One of the potential factors that can influence the accuracy of broadband ultrasound attenuation measurement is the effect of cortical end plates. This study aimed to explore this, performing a comparison of experimental study and computer simulation prediction. A total of three categories of thin discs were three-dimensional (3D) printed to replicate cortical shells of (1) variable constant thickness (planar), (2) variable constant thickness (curved), and (3) variable thickness. A through-transmission technique was used, where two single-element, unfocused, 1-MHz broadband transducers, as utilised clinically, were positioned coaxially in a cylindrical holder and immersed in water. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated that broadband ultrasound attenuation measurements of the 'planar' and 'curved' discs were statistically equal (p-values &gt; 0.01). A cyclic relationship between broadband ultrasound attenuation and disc thickness was observed; this was replicated within a computer simulation of phase interference created by a double-reflection echo within each disc (R2= 97.0%). Variable-thickness discs provided broadband ultrasound attenuation measurements ranging between 31.6 ± 0.1 and 40.60 ± 0.1 dB/MHz. Again applying the double-reflection echo simulation, a high level of agreement between experimental and simulation was recorded (R2= 93.4%). This study indicates that the cortical end plate can significantly affect the broadband ultrasound attenuation measurement of cancellous bone as a result of phase interference and, therefore, warrants further investigation to minimise its effect on clinical assessment." />

    <field content="Abstract：To clarify if leucocyte count progression can predict one-week mortality in unselected medical patients admitted to the emergency department. Additionally, we investigated the importance of leucocyte count progression for admission to the intensive care unit and length of stay.This retrospective cohort study uses data collected in two phases from patients admitted through the emergency department at Hospital of South West Jutland. Upon admission, a nurse recorded the primary complaint and vital signs and registered these along with demographic information. Blood test results were subsequently extracted from the hospital's computer systems. Patients were separated into three groups according to the development in their leucocyte count from the day of admission to the day after.The total cohort was 5894 patients; 30.5% remained after exclusion. Median age was 71, and 50.3% were female. Using logistic regression, we found significantly lower one-week mortality with falling leucocyte count progression, even when controlling for confounders. A decreasing leucocyte count had a sensitivity for one-week mortality of 65%, specificity of 62%, positive predictive value of 4%, and negative predictive value of 99%. Difference in admission to the intensive care unit was non-significant between the three groups. Difference in length of stay was significant, but with one day difference, the clinical significance is questionable.Leucocyte count progression is not sensitive enough to predict one-week mortality, nor specific enough to discount it. It is important for physicians to be aware of this to avoid faulty assessments based on imprecise assumptions." />

    <field content="Abstract：Natural language processing (NLP) has become an increasingly significant role in advancing medicine. Rich research achievements of NLP methods and applications for medical information processing are available. It is of great significance to conduct a deep analysis to understand the recent development of NLP-empowered medical research field. However, limited study examining the research status of this field could be found. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively assess the academic output of NLP in medical research field.We conducted a bibliometric analysis on NLP-empowered medical research publications retrieved from PubMed in the period 2007-2016. The analysis focused on three aspects. Firstly, the literature distribution characteristics were obtained with a statistics analysis method. Secondly, a network analysis method was used to reveal scientific collaboration relations. Finally, thematic discovery and evolution was reflected using an affinity propagation clustering method.There were 1405 NLP-empowered medical research publications published during the 10 years with an average annual growth rate of 18.39%. 10 most productive publication sources together contributed more than 50% of the total publications. The USA had the highest number of publications. A moderately significant correlation between country's publications and GDP per capita was revealed. Denny, Joshua C was the most productive author. Mayo Clinic was the most productive affiliation. The annual co-affiliation and co-country rates reached 64.04% and 15.79% in 2016, respectively. 10 main great thematic areas were identified including Computational biology, Terminology mining, Information extraction, Text classification, Social medium as data source, Information retrieval, etc. CONCLUSIONS: A bibliometric analysis of NLP-empowered medical research publications for uncovering the recent research status is presented. The results can assist relevant researchers, especially newcomers in understanding the research development systematically, seeking scientific cooperation partners, optimizing research topic choices and monitoring new scientific or technological activities." />

    <field content="Abstract：Identifying targets of herbs is a primary step for investigating pharmacological mechanisms of herbal drugs in Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Experimental targets identification of herbs is a difficult and time-consuming work. Computational method for identifying herb targets is an efficient approach. However, how to make full use of heterogeneous network data about herbs and targets to improve the performance of herb targets prediction is still a dilemma.In our study, a random walk algorithm on the heterogeneous herb-target network (named heNetRW) has been proposed to identify protein targets of herbs. By building a heterogeneous herb-target network involving herbs, targets and their interactions and simulating random walk algorithm on the network, the candidate targets of the given herb can be predicted.The experimental results on large-scale dataset showed that heNetRW had higher performance of targets prediction than PRINCE (improved F1-score by 0.08 and Hit@1 by 21.34% in one validation setting, and improved F1-score by 0.54 and Hit@1 by 69.08% in the other validation setting). Furthermore, we evaluated novel candidate targets of two herbs (rhizoma coptidis and turmeric), which showed our approach could generate potential targets that are valuable for further experimental investigations.Compared with PRINCE algorithm, heNetRW algorithm can fuse more known information (such as, known herb-target associations and pathway-based similarities of protein pairs) to improve prediction performance. Experimental results also indicated heNetRW had higher performance than PRINCE. The prediction results not only can be used to guide the selection of candidate targets of herbs, but also help to reveal the molecule mechanisms of herbal drugs." />

    <field content="Abstract：Decomposing a protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) into non-overlapping clusters or communities, sometimes called &quot;network modules,&quot; is an important way to explore functional roles of sets of genes. When the method to accomplish this decomposition is solely based on purely graph-theoretic measures of the interconnection structure of the network, this is often called unsupervised clustering or community detection. In this study, we compare unsupervised computational methods for decomposing a PPI network into non-overlapping modules. A method is preferred if it results in a large proportion of nodes being assigned to functionally meaningful modules, as measured by functional enrichment over terms from the Gene Ontology (GO).We compare the performance of three popular community detection algorithms with the same algorithms run after the network is pre-processed by removing and reweighting based on the diffusion state distance (DSD) between pairs of nodes in the network. We call this &quot;detangling&quot; the network. In almost all cases, we find that detangling the network based on the DSD distance reweighting provides more meaningful clusters.Re-embedding using the DSD distance metric, before applying standard community detection algorithms, can assist in uncovering GO functionally enriched clusters in the yeast PPI network." />

    <field content="Abstract：Expression-based phenotype classification using either microarray or RNA-Seq measurements suffers from a lack of specificity because pathway timing is not revealed and expressions are averaged across groups of cells. This paper studies expression-based classification under the assumption that single-cell measurements are sampled at a sufficient rate to detect regulatory timing. Thus, observations are expression trajectories. In effect, classification is performed on data generated by an underlying gene regulatory network.Network regulation is modeled via a Boolean network with perturbation, regulation not fully determined owing to inherent biological randomness. The binary assumption is not critical because the resulting Markov chain characterizes expression trajectories. We assume a partially known Gaussian observation model belonging to an uncertainty class of models. We derive the intrinsically Bayesian robust classifier to discriminate between wild-type and mutated networks based on expression trajectories. The classifier minimizes the expected error across the uncertainty class relative to the prior distribution. We test it using a mammalian cell-cycle model, discriminating between the normal network and one in which gene p27 is mutated, thereby producing a cancerous phenotype. Tests examine all model aspects, including trajectory length, perturbation probability, and the hyperparameters governing the prior distribution over the uncertainty class.Simulations show the rates at which the expected error is diminished by smaller perturbation probability, longer trajectories, and hyperparameters that tighten the prior distribution relative to the unknown true network. For average-expression measurement, methods have been proposed to obtain prior distributions. These should be extended to the more mathematically difficult, but more informative, expression trajectories." />

    <field content="Abstract：Temporal expression extraction and normalization is a fundamental and essential step in clinical text processing and analyzing. Though a variety of commonly used NLP tools are available for medical temporal information extraction, few work is satisfactory for multi-lingual heterogeneous clinical texts.A novel method called TEER is proposed for both multi-lingual temporal expression extraction and normalization from various types of narrative clinical texts including clinical data requests, clinical notes, and clinical trial summaries. TEER is characterized as temporal feature summarization, heuristic rule generation, and automatic pattern learning. By representing a temporal expression as a triple &lt;M, A, N&gt;, TEER identifies temporal mentions M, assigns type attributes A to M, and normalizes the values of M into formal representations N.Based on two heterogeneous clinical text datasets: 400 actual clinical requests in English and 1459 clinical discharge summaries in Chinese. TEER was compared with six state-of-the-art baselines. The results showed that TEER achieved a precision of 0.948 and a recall of 0.877 on the English clinical requests, while a precision of 0.941 and a recall of 0.932 on the Chinese discharge summaries.An automated method TEER for multi-lingual temporal expression extraction was presented. Based on the two datasets containing heterogeneous clinical texts, the comparison results demonstrated the effectiveness of the TEER method in multi-lingual temporal expression extraction from heterogeneous narrative clinical texts." />

    <field content="Abstract：Genotype-phenotype association has been one of the long-standing problems in bioinformatics. Identifying both the marginal and epistatic effects among genetic markers, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), has been extensively integrated in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to help derive &quot;causal&quot; genetic risk factors and their interactions, which play critical roles in life and disease systems. Identifying &quot;synergistic&quot; interactions with respect to the outcome of interest can help accurate phenotypic prediction and understand the underlying mechanism of system behavior. Many statistical measures for estimating synergistic interactions have been proposed in the literature for such a purpose. However, except for empirical performance, there is still no theoretical analysis on the power and limitation of these synergistic interaction measures.In this paper, it is shown that the existing information-theoretic multivariate synergy depends on a small subset of the interaction parameters in the model, sometimes on only one interaction parameter. In addition, an adjusted version of multivariate synergy is proposed as a new measure to estimate the interactive effects, with experiments conducted over both simulated data sets and a real-world GWAS data set to show the effectiveness.We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evidence on why the information-theoretic multivariate synergy helps with identifying genetic risk factors via synergistic interactions. We further establish the rigorous sample complexity analysis on detecting interactive effects, confirmed by both simulated and real-world data sets." />
