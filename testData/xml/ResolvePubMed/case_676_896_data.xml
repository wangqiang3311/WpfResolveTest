    <field content="Abstract：This study investigated the midterm results after sole percutaneous treatment for central depression fractures of the base of the middle phalanx.19 men and 2 women with an average age of 31.9 (18 - 57) years with a central depression fracture of the middle phalanx treated solely by intramedullary reposition with a bended K-wire and percutaneous K-wire fixation were followed on average of 13.2 (3 - 40) months.At the time of the last follow-up, all patients were able to pursue their previous occupational activity as well as their usual leisure activities and were painfree (VAS 0). The postoperative active flexion of the affected PIP joint was 86° with an average extension deficit of 1° or 93 % of the range of motion of the uninjured PIPJ of the opposite side. Radiologically there was a nice remodeling of the articular surface with no osteoarthrosis. There were no pin-associated complications or wound healing disorders.The sole intramedullary reduction with K-wire osteosynthesis is a suitable and reliable method for the treatment of the central impression fracture. Good functional results can be achieved with low surgical effort.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract：Clinical presentation of carpal tunnel syndrome may differ in relation to certain factors like sex, age, duration of symptoms and severity of compression. The objective of this study was an investigation into the hypothesis that several distinct factors are predictive of the clinical profile for the condition. The records of 1,117 patients: 909 women (81 %) and 208 men (19 %) with a mean age of 63 years, were analysed. The whole group was divided into subgroups, depending on the variables analysed: sex, age, duration of the condition, severity of symptoms, severity of electrophysiological abnormalities and occurrence or lack of comorbidities.Of all the considered variables, the Levine symptom scores had the greatest impact on the condition's clinical profile: the higher scores the more severe pain, poorer sensation, weaker grip and worse hand function. Also, ages greater than 80 years had a significant negative effect on most of the considered parameters. None of the remaining analysed variables had a substantial impact on the clinical profile of the condition.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract：Pharmaceutical oxytocin (OT) administration is being tested as a novel treatment for social deficits in various psychiatric populations. However, little is known about how naturally occurring variation in peripheral OT relates to differences in social cognition. This study investigates whether healthy individuals with very high or very low levels of empathy differ in endogenous OT and whether OT plasma levels can predict performance in a mentalizing task.40 healthy men were included based upon their score above the 85thor below the 15thpercentile of the empathy quotient inventory 1. Participants' abilities to interpret social information was assessed via the Social Detection Task 2. Plasma OT levels were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay.OT plasma levels predicted mentalizing performance for more ambiguous social scenes (i. e., difficult items) for all participants. We found no group differences in OT plasma levels between subjects with high and low empathy.These findings confirm a link between peripheral OT and the ability to read subtle nonverbal social cues in healthy individuals, which is independent of self-reported empathy.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract：Evidence from animal studies indicates that hyperinsulinemia, without changes in glucose, increases ventilation via a carotid body-mediated mechanism. However, whether insulin elevates ventilation in humans independently of changes in glucose remains unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that insulin increases ventilation in humans during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in which insulin was elevated to postprandial concentrations while glucose was maintained at fasting concentrations. First, in 16 healthy young men (Protocol 1), we retrospectively analyzed respiration rate and estimated tidal volume from a pneumobelt to calculate minute-ventilation during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. In addition, for a direct assessment of minute-ventilation during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we retrospectively analyzed breath-by-breath respiration rate and tidal volume from inspired/ expired gasses in an additional 23 healthy young subjects (Protocol 2). Clamp infusion elevated minute-ventilation from baseline in both protocols (Protocol 1: +11.9 {plus minus} 4.6 % baseline, P = 0.001; Protocol 2: +9.5 {plus minus} 3.8 % baseline, P = 0.020). In Protocol 1, peak changes in both respiration rate (+13.9 {plus minus} 3.0 % baseline, P &lt; 0.001) and estimated tidal volume (+16.9 {plus minus} 4.1 % baseline, P = 0.001) were higher than baseline during the clamp. In Protocol 2, tidal volume primarily increased during the clamp (+9.7 {plus minus} 3.7 % baseline, P = 0.016), as respiration rate did not change significantly (+0.2 {plus minus} 1.8 % baseline, P = 0.889). Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time in humans that elevated plasma insulin increases minute-ventilation independent of changes in glucose." />

    <field content="Abstract：The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC-1) is a key nutrient and contraction-sensitive protein that regulates a pathway leading to skeletal muscle growth. Utilizing a multiplex assay, we aimed to examine the phosphorylation status of key mTORC-1-related signalling molecules in response to protein feeding and resistance exercise.Eight healthy men (22.5 ± 3.1 yr, 80 ± 9 kg, 1-repetition maximum [1RM] leg extension: 87 ± 5 kg) performed 4 sets of unilateral leg extensions until volitional failure. Immediately following the final set, all participants consumed a protein-enriched beverage. A single skeletal muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis before (Pre) with further bilateral biopsies at 1 h (1 h FEDEX and 1 h FED) and 3 h (3 h FEDEX and 3 h FED) post drink ingestion Results: Phosphorylated Akt Ser473 was significantly elevated from Pre at 1 h FEDEX. Phosphorylated p70S6K1 Thr412 was significantly increased above Pre at 1 h FEDEX and 1 h FED and was still significantly elevated at 3 h FEDEX but not 3 h FED. Phosphorylated rpS6 Ser235/236 was also significantly increased above Pre at 1 h FEDEX and 1 h FED with 1 h FEDEX greater than 1 h FED.Our data highlight the utility of a multiplex assay to assess anabolic signaling molecules in response to protein feeding and resistance exercise in humans. Importantly, these changes are comparable to those as previously reported using standard immunoblotting and protein activity assays." />

    <field content="Abstract：Although there are several diseases that cause erythroderma, patients are often encountered with erythroderma of unknown cause which persists for a long time. The aim of this study was to characterize this chronic idiopathic erythroderma (CIE).Adult patients with CIE, atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriatic erythroderma (PsE), or generalized drug eruption (DE), who visited Fukuoka University Hospital Dermatology Department from 2010 to 2015, were enrolled. Their clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the patient database. CIE was defined as erythroderma without any apparent cause and lasting more than 3 months.Twenty-three CIE, 82 AD, 39 psoriatic erythroderma, and 99 drug eruption cases were enrolled. The mean age of CIE patients was 74.7 ± 8.8, and the male : female ratio was 21 : 2. Laboratory data for CIE and AD were similar, but serum levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), a T-helper (Th) 2 cytokine, in the CIE group were significantly more elevated than in the AD group. Conversely, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels were significantly lower in CIE patients compared with the atopic dermatitis group, and the ROC curve of the TARC/IgE ratio (7.24) provided efficient differentiation of the CIE group from AD patients. About PsE and DE, significant elevation of C-reactive protein was observed. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were also elevated in DE.Chronic idiopathic erythroderma is an independent condition which is likely to occur in elderly men. Immunity is shifted to the Th2 type in CIE; however, the mechanism may differ from that of atopic dermatitis.© 2018 The International Society of Dermatology." />

    <field content="Abstract：The current analysis examines sex differences in longitudinal changes in genetic and environmental influences on three measures of subjective health.Sample includes 7372 twins (mean intake age = 73.22) with up to 8 waves of measurement (mean = 3.1). Three subjective health (SH) items were included: general self-rated health (SRH), health compared to age peers (COMP), and impact of health on activities (ACT) which previous research shows capture different frames of reference.Latent growth curve modeling indicated significant differences across gender and frame of reference in trajectories of change with age and in genetic and environmental contributions to change. Men have higher mean scores on all three SH measures, indicating better SH, but there were no sex differences in pattern of change with age. Accelerating declines with age were found for SRH and ACT, whereas COMP improved with age. Results indicated more genetic variance for women than men, but declining genetic variance for both after age 70. Increasing shared environmental variance with increasing age was also found for both sexes.As aging triggers a re-evaluation of the meaning of &quot;good health,&quot; physical aspects of health may become less important and shared cultural conceptions of health may become more relevant. This change in conceptions of good health may reflect both aging and the change in composition of the elderly population as a result of selective survival." />

    <field content="Abstract：The association between disability and cause of death in Veterans with service-connected disabilities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare age at death, military service and disability characteristics, including disability rating, and cause of death by year of birth. We also examined cause of death for specific service-connected conditions.This study used information from the VETSNET file, which is a snapshot of selected items from the Veterans Benefits Administration corporate database. We also used the National Death Index (NDI) for Veterans which is part of the VA Suicide Data Repository. In VETSNET, there were 758,324 Veterans who had a service-connected condition and died between the years 2004 and 2014. Using the scrambled social security number to link the two files resulted in 605,493 (80%) deceased Veterans. Age at death, sex, and underlying cause of death were obtained from the NDI for Veterans and military service characteristics and types of disability were acquired from VETSNET. We constructed age categories corresponding to period of service; birth years 1938 and earlier corresponded to Korea and World War II (&quot;oldest&quot;), birth years 1939-1957 to the Vietnam era (&quot;middle&quot;), and birth years 1958 and later to post Vietnam, Gulf War, and the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (&quot;youngest&quot;).Sixty-two percent were in the oldest age category, 34% in the middle group, and 4% in the youngest one. The overall age at death was 75 ± 13 yr. Only 1.6% of decedents were women; among women 25% were in the youngest age group, while among men only 4% were in the youngest group. Most decedents were enlisted personnel, and 60% served in the U.S. Army. Nearly 61% had a disability rating of &gt;50% and for the middle age group 54% had a disability rating of 100%. The most common service-connected conditions were tinnitus, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the oldest group, nearly half of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions and &lt;2% were due to external causes. In the youngest group, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for about 1/3 of deaths, whereas external causes or deaths due to accidents, suicide, or assault accounted for nearly 33% of deaths. For Veterans with service-connected PTSD or major depression; 6.5% of deaths were due to external causes whereas for Veterans without these conditions, only 3.1% were due to external causes.The finding of premature death due to external causes in the youngest age group as well as the finding of higher proportions of external causes in those with PTSD or major depression should be of great concern to those who care for Veterans." />

    <field content="Abstract：Drawing on the &quot;Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH community in South Africa&quot; (HAALSI) baseline survey, we present data on older adults' social networks and receipt of social support in rural South Africa. We examine how age and gender differences in social network characteristics matched with patterns predicted by theories of choice- and constraint-based network contraction in older adults.We used regression analysis on data for 5,059 South African adults aged 40 and older.Older respondents reported fewer important social contacts and less frequent communication than their middle-aged peers, largely due to fewer nonkin connections. Network size difference between older and younger respondents was greater for women than for men. These gender and age differences were explicable by much higher levels of widowhood among older women compared to younger women and older men. There was no evidence for employment-related network contraction or selective retention of emotionally supportive ties.Marriage-related structural constraints impacted on older women's social networks in rural South Africa, but did not explain choice-based network contraction. These findings suggest that many older women in rural Africa, a growing population, may have an unmet need for social support." />

    <field content="Abstract：This study primarily examines the associations between histories of childhood maltreatment (i.e., neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse) and elder abuse victimization and explores whether gender moderates the associations.We conducted a secondary data analysis of 5,968 older adults (mean age = 71 years) based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (2010-2011). Using retrospective self-reports of childhood and current (past 12 months) victimization experiences, logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of early-life adversities on the likelihood of elder abuse victimization.Results indicate that childhood emotional abuse and childhood sexual abuse were associated with greater risk of being abused as older adults, after controlling for childhood and adult background factors. We also found that the effect of childhood sexual abuse on elder abuse victimization was weaker for women than men.Findings suggest that the phenomenon of revictimization may occur not only in early and middle adulthood, but also in late life. To advance our understanding of victimization across the life course, future research on root causes of elder abuse should include histories of child abuse." />

    <field content="Abstract：Although the increase in the number of centenarians is well documented today in countries with advanced demographic data, the same is not true for those aged 105 and over. The first aim of this paper, was to analyze the demographic characteristics of the 4,626 validated semi-super and 102 supercentenarians for the cohorts born between 1896 and 1910, referring to Italian Semi-Supercentenarians Survey (SSC). Then, starting from this data and from the survival  histories  in old ages - reconstructed by Vincent's Extinct - Cohort Method - for the cohorts born between 1870 and 1904, the most important aim was to analyze longevity history and the trend of gender gap of the Italian oldest cohorts beyond 100 years old.  The Italian centenarians and semi-supercentenarians increase from the first to the last cohort is due to the survival rise in old ages and the increase in the gender gap at extreme ages depends on the higher survival of women than men after 60 years old. Around 110-112 for both genders (for women in particular) a kind of resistance to further progress seems to appear in our analysis as in more recent studies on supercentenarians." />

    <field content="Abstract：ACRIN 6686/RTOG 0825 was a phase III trial of conventional chemoradiation plus adjuvant temozolomide with bevacizumab or without (placebo) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. This study investigated whether changes in contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense tumor assessed by central reading prognosticate overall survival (OS).284 patients (171 men; median age 57 years, range 19-79; 159 on bevacizumab) had MRI at post-op (baseline) and pre-cycle 4 of adjuvant temozolomide (22 weeks post- chemoradiation initiation). Four central readers measured bi-dimensional lesion enhancement (2D-T1) and FLAIR hyperintensity at both time points. Changes from baseline to pre-cycle 4 for both markers were dichotomized (increasing versus non-increasing). Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used for inference.Adjusting for treatment, increasing 2D-T1 (n=262, HR=2.07 [95% CI 1.48-2.91], p&lt;0.0001) and FLAIR (n=273, HR=1.75 [1.26-2.41], p=0.0008) significantly predicted worse OS. Median OS (days) was significantly shorter for patients with increasing versus non-increasing 2D-T1 for both bevacizumab (443 vs. 535, p=0.004) and placebo (526 vs. 887, p=0.001). Median OS was significantly shorter for patients with increasing versus non-increasing FLAIR for placebo (595 vs. 872, p=0.001), and trended similarly for bevacizumab (499 vs. 535, p=0.0935). Adjusting for 2D-T1 and treatment, increasing FLAIR represented significantly higher risk for death (HR=1.59 [1.11-2.26], p=0.01).Increased 2D-T1 significantly predicts worse OS in both treatment groups, implying absence of a substantial proportion of pseudoprogression 22 weeks after initiation of standard therapy. FLAIR adds value beyond 2D-T1 in predicting OS, potentially addressing the pseudoresponse effect by sub-stratifying bevacizumab-treated patients with non-increasing 2D-T1." />

    <field content="Abstract：Foot drill is a key component of military training and is characterized by frequent heel stamping, likely resulting in high tibial shock magnitudes. Higher tibial shock during running has previously been associated with risk of lower limb stress fractures, which are prevalent among military populations. Quantification of tibial shock during drill training is, therefore, warranted. This study aimed to provide estimates of tibial shock during military drill in British Army Basic training. The study also aimed to compare values between men and women, and to identify any differences between the first and final sessions of training.Tibial accelerometers were secured on the right medial, distal shank of 10 British Army recruits (n = 5 men; n = 5 women) throughout a scheduled drill training session in week 1 and week 12 of basic military training. Peak positive accelerations, the average magnitude above given thresholds, and the rate at which each threshold was exceeded were quantified.Mean (SD) peak positive acceleration was 20.8 (2.2) g across all sessions, which is considerably higher than values typically observed during high impact physical activity. Magnitudes of tibial shock were higher in men than women, and higher in week 12 compared with week 1 of training.This study provides the first estimates of tibial shock magnitude during military drill training in the field. The high values suggest that military drill is a demanding activity and this should be considered when developing and evaluating military training programs. Further exploration is required to understand the response of the lower limb to military drill training and the etiology of these responses in the development of lower limb stress fractures." />

    <field content="Abstract：The purpose of this report is to describe the evaluation and treatment of a patient with neck pain and ankylosing spondylitis who had underlying atlantoaxial instability. The patient was a 31-yr-old man diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis 1 yr prior who was referred to a physical therapist for the treatment of chronic, worsening low back and hip pain. He also had secondary complaints of neck, upper back, and shoulder pain. The patient worked as a military pilot. As part of the patient's physical examination, a Sharp-Purser test was performed, which was positive for excessive motion. Diagnostic imaging confirmed the atlantoaxial instability; it was also determined that the patient's atlanto-occipital joints were fused. Despite evidence of atlantoaxial instability, it was determined the patient would be managed through nonsurgical interventions. The patient was prescribed etanercept by his rheumatologist and the physical therapist developed a comprehensive rehabilitation program that addressed relevant impairments of the spine, hips, and shoulders. At 3 yr following his initial evaluation with the physical therapist, the patient continued to report minimal bodily pain and no limitations in his functional capabilities. Additionally, the patient had earned a high profile flying position with an aggressive flying schedule and he successfully completed his first running marathon. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding of the clinical findings associated with atlantoaxial instability, as these findings provide guidance for diagnostic imaging and specialist referral prior to initiating conservative management strategies, such as physical therapy." />

    <field content="Abstract：Thyroid nodules, adenomas, and goiter have consistently been associated with thyroid cancer risk. Few studies have assessed whether thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity influence this risk.To examine thyroid cancer risk following diagnoses of a wide range of benign thyroid conditions.Hospital and cancer registry linkage cohort study for the years 1978-2013.Nationwide (Denmark).Patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (n=85,169), hypothyroidism (n=63,143), thyroiditis (n=12,532), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=65,782), simple goiter (n=11,582), other/unspecified goiter (n=21,953), or adenoma (n=6,481) among 8,258,807 residents of Denmark during the study period.We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for differentiated thyroid cancer, excluding the first 12 months of follow-up after benign thyroid disease diagnosis.SIRs were significantly elevated for all benign thyroid diseases apart from hypothyroidism. SIRs were higher for men than women and in the earlier follow-up periods. Elevated SIRs were observed for localized and regional/distant thyroid cancer. After excluding the first 10 years of follow-up, hyperthyroidism (n=27 thyroid cancer cases, SIR=2.00, 95% CI 1.32-2.92), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=83, SIR=4.91, 95% CI 3.91-6.09), simple goiter (n=8, SIR=4.33, 95% CI 1.87-8.53), other/unspecified goiter (n=20, SIR=3.94, 95% CI 2.40-6.08), and adenoma (n=9, SIR=6.02, 95% CI 2.76-11.5) remained positively associated with thyroid cancer risk.We found an unexpected increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer, including regional/distant disease, following diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis that could not be solely attributed to increased medical surveillance. Hypothyroidism was less clearly associated with thyroid cancer risk." />

    <field content="Abstract：The long-term effects of military deployment on the mental health of war veterans have been investigated extensively, but few studies have examined the long-term impact of parental deployment on children's mental health.Using a retrospective, multigenerational survey and propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects and endogeneity bias, we investigated the impact of parental deployment on the mental health of the adult children of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. We analysed data from 1966 adult men (35%) and women (65%) whose fathers (N = 1418) were selected at random from the population of surviving men who served in the Australian army during the Vietnam War (1962-75). Mean age of respondents was 37. The main outcome measures were self-reported diagnosis or treatment for anxiety and depression (i.e. lifetime and previous 12 months), suicidality based on Psychiatric Symptom Frequency Scale, and current mental health as measured by the Mental Health Inventory of the SF-36. The key independent variable was whether their fathers were deployed to the Vietnam War.Almost 40 years after the war, the adult children of deployed veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.28] and depression (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.03, 3.05), to have had thoughts of suicide and self-harm (OR = 2.39, CI = 1.57, 3.65) and to have made suicidal plans (OR = 3.52, CI = 1.40, 8.85) than the offspring of comparable, non-deployed army veterans. They also reported poorer current mental health (Coefficient = -5.08, CI = -6.60 - -3.56).The results imply that there are significant and enduring adverse effects of parental deployment on the mental health of children in military families, and provide some insight into the potential long-term impacts of recent military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq." />

    <field content="Abstract：More than half of all patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience a relapse within 2 years after recovery. It is unclear how relapse affects brain morphologic features during the course of MDD.To use structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify morphologic brain changes associated with relapse in MDD.In this longitudinal case-control study, patients with acute MDD at baseline and healthy controls were recruited from the University of Münster Department of Psychiatry from March 21, 2010, to November 14, 2014, and were reassessed from November 11, 2012, to October 28, 2016. Depending on patients' course of illness during follow-up, they were subdivided into groups of patients with and without relapse. Whole-brain gray matter volume and cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and insula were assessed via 3-T magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 2 years later.Gray matter was analyzed via group (no relapse, relapse, and healthy controls) by time (baseline and follow-up) analysis of covariance, controlling for age and total intracranial volume. Confounding factors of medication and depression severity were assessed.This study included 37 patients with MDD and a relapse (19 women and 18 men; mean [SD] age, 37.0 [12.7] years), 23 patients with MDD and without relapse (13 women and 10 men; mean [SD] age, 32.5 [10.5] years), and 54 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (24 women and 30 men; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [8.7] years). A significant group-by-time interaction controlling for age and total intracranial volume revealed that patients with relapse showed a significant decline of insular volume (difference, -0.032; 95% CI, -0.063 to -0.002; P = .04) and dorsolateral prefrontal volume (difference, -0.079; 95% CI, -0.113 to -0.045; P &lt; .001) from baseline to follow-up. In patients without relapse, gray matter volume in these regions did not change significantly (insula: difference, 0.027; 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.066; P = .17; and dorsolateral prefrontal volume: difference, 0.023; 95% CI, -0.020 to 0.066; P = .30). Volume changes were not correlated with psychiatric medication or with severity of depression at follow-up. Additional analysis of cortical thickness showed an increase in the anterior cingulate cortex (difference, 0.073 mm; 95% CI, 0.023-0.123 mm; P = .005) and orbitofrontal cortex (difference, 0.089 mm; 95% CI, 0.032-0.147 mm; P = .003) from baseline to follow-up in patients without relapse.A distinct association of relapse in MDD with brain morphologic features was revealed using a longitudinal design. Relapse is associated with brain structures that are crucial for regulation of emotions and thus needs to be prevented. This study might be a step to guide future prognosis and maintenance treatment in patients with recurrent MDD." />

    <field content="Abstract：We aim to adjust for potential non-participation bias in the prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption.Population survey data from Finnish health examination surveys conducted in 1987-2007 were linked to the administrative registers for mortality and morbidity follow-up until end of 2014. Utilising these data, available for both participants and non-participants, we model the association between heavy alcohol consumption and alcohol-related disease diagnoses.Our results show that the estimated prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption is on average of 1.5 times higher for men and 1.8 times higher for women than what was obtained from participants only (complete case analysis). The magnitude of the difference in the mean estimates by year varies from 0 to 9 percentage points for men and from 0 to 2 percentage points for women.The proposed approach improves the prevalence estimation but requires follow-up data on non-participants and Bayesian modelling." />
