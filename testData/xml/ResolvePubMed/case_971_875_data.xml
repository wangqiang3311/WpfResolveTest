    <field content="Abstract：This study investigated the midterm results after sole percutaneous treatment for central depression fractures of the base of the middle phalanx.19 men and 2 women with an average age of 31.9 (18 - 57) years with a central depression fracture of the middle phalanx treated solely by intramedullary reposition with a bended K-wire and percutaneous K-wire fixation were followed on average of 13.2 (3 - 40) months.At the time of the last follow-up, all patients were able to pursue their previous occupational activity as well as their usual leisure activities and were painfree (VAS 0). The postoperative active flexion of the affected PIP joint was 86° with an average extension deficit of 1° or 93 % of the range of motion of the uninjured PIPJ of the opposite side. Radiologically there was a nice remodeling of the articular surface with no osteoarthrosis. There were no pin-associated complications or wound healing disorders.The sole intramedullary reduction with K-wire osteosynthesis is a suitable and reliable method for the treatment of the central impression fracture. Good functional results can be achieved with low surgical effort.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract：Clinical presentation of carpal tunnel syndrome may differ in relation to certain factors like sex, age, duration of symptoms and severity of compression. The objective of this study was an investigation into the hypothesis that several distinct factors are predictive of the clinical profile for the condition. The records of 1,117 patients: 909 women (81 %) and 208 men (19 %) with a mean age of 63 years, were analysed. The whole group was divided into subgroups, depending on the variables analysed: sex, age, duration of the condition, severity of symptoms, severity of electrophysiological abnormalities and occurrence or lack of comorbidities.Of all the considered variables, the Levine symptom scores had the greatest impact on the condition's clinical profile: the higher scores the more severe pain, poorer sensation, weaker grip and worse hand function. Also, ages greater than 80 years had a significant negative effect on most of the considered parameters. None of the remaining analysed variables had a substantial impact on the clinical profile of the condition.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract： The incidence of a fetal single umbilical artery (SUA) is about 0.5 % and has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, fetal aneuploidy and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A retrospective analysis of 1169 women with singleton pregnancies diagnosed with fetal SUA between 1997 and 2014 in a specialized practice for prenatal diagnostics has been performed. Data was obtained on maternal and fetal findings as well as pregnancy outcome. 989 (84.6 %) fetuses showed an isolated SUA (iSUA) while 180 (15.4 %) presented with SUA and additional structural and/or chromosomal abnormalities. Structural malformations were distributed as follows: 9.0 % cardiovascular, 3.5 % urogenital, 2.9 % musculoskeletal, 3.0 % gastrointestinal and 2.1 % cerebral. 2.1 % of the fetuses had chromosomal aberrations. 50.8 % (49.2 %) of the fetuses were female (male) and right vs. left SUA was found in 64.2 % (35.8 %) of the cases. Fetuses with SUA and additional abnormalities showed lower rates of live births (85.0 % vs. 98.5 %, p &lt; 0.001), a lower median birth weight (2825 g vs. 3220 g, p &lt; 0.001), higher rates of preterm delivery before week 34 + 0 (13.7 % vs. 3.8 %, p &lt; 0.001) and weighed less than the 5th growth percentile in 21.6 % vs. 9.3 % (p &lt; 0.001) of the fetuses with iSUA. In 5.1 % (60) of the children, chromosomal or structural abnormalities were detected post-partum. Once fetal SUA is diagnosed, intense sonoanatomy of the fetus is required and, if associated malformations are found, genetic testing must be offered. In iSUA intermittent biometry is recommended for the early detection of IUGR but additional genetic testing is not necessarily recommended.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York." />

    <field content="Abstract：In coming decades, fetal medicine may become a routine part of reproductive care. The measures pregnant women now take to protect fetal health are largely generic, like restricting their diets and using supplements. Relatively few interventions are based on specific conditions revealed by ultrasound or genetic testing. A recent finding, though, may herald a dramatic rise in &quot;personalized&quot; fetal medicine: certain drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration can apparently boost neural growth in fetuses with Down syndrome, improving cognitive functioning in the future child. Many more condition-specific findings are likely in the near future. But as commentators have frequently observed about prenatal testing, technologies that appear to increase reproductive options also complicate and constrain them.© 2018 The Hastings Center." />

    <field content="Abstract：January 2018, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology issued a position statement opposing the punishment of women for self-induced abortion. To those unfamiliar with emerging trends in abortion in the United States and worldwide, the need for the declaration might not be apparent. Several studies suggest that self-induced abortion is on the rise in the United States. Simultaneously, prosecutions of pregnant women for behavior thought to harm the fetus are increasing. The ACOG statement responds to both trends by urging doctors to honor the integrity and confidentiality inherent in the doctor-patient relationship. Seen in the context of the larger battle over legal abortion, the statement has far broader implications. By acknowledging the role doctors play in enforcing pregnancy-related crimes, the ACOG position statement wisely anticipates the ways in which doctors will be implicated should access to legal abortion be further restricted. To understand the need for the ACOG directive, you must first understand that the story of what will happen if abortion becomes a crime in the United States is not to be found in history books; it is staring at us across our southern border.© 2018 The Hastings Center." />

    <field content="Abstract：The current analysis examines sex differences in longitudinal changes in genetic and environmental influences on three measures of subjective health.Sample includes 7372 twins (mean intake age = 73.22) with up to 8 waves of measurement (mean = 3.1). Three subjective health (SH) items were included: general self-rated health (SRH), health compared to age peers (COMP), and impact of health on activities (ACT) which previous research shows capture different frames of reference.Latent growth curve modeling indicated significant differences across gender and frame of reference in trajectories of change with age and in genetic and environmental contributions to change. Men have higher mean scores on all three SH measures, indicating better SH, but there were no sex differences in pattern of change with age. Accelerating declines with age were found for SRH and ACT, whereas COMP improved with age. Results indicated more genetic variance for women than men, but declining genetic variance for both after age 70. Increasing shared environmental variance with increasing age was also found for both sexes.As aging triggers a re-evaluation of the meaning of &quot;good health,&quot; physical aspects of health may become less important and shared cultural conceptions of health may become more relevant. This change in conceptions of good health may reflect both aging and the change in composition of the elderly population as a result of selective survival." />

    <field content="Abstract：The association between disability and cause of death in Veterans with service-connected disabilities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare age at death, military service and disability characteristics, including disability rating, and cause of death by year of birth. We also examined cause of death for specific service-connected conditions.This study used information from the VETSNET file, which is a snapshot of selected items from the Veterans Benefits Administration corporate database. We also used the National Death Index (NDI) for Veterans which is part of the VA Suicide Data Repository. In VETSNET, there were 758,324 Veterans who had a service-connected condition and died between the years 2004 and 2014. Using the scrambled social security number to link the two files resulted in 605,493 (80%) deceased Veterans. Age at death, sex, and underlying cause of death were obtained from the NDI for Veterans and military service characteristics and types of disability were acquired from VETSNET. We constructed age categories corresponding to period of service; birth years 1938 and earlier corresponded to Korea and World War II (&quot;oldest&quot;), birth years 1939-1957 to the Vietnam era (&quot;middle&quot;), and birth years 1958 and later to post Vietnam, Gulf War, and the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (&quot;youngest&quot;).Sixty-two percent were in the oldest age category, 34% in the middle group, and 4% in the youngest one. The overall age at death was 75 ± 13 yr. Only 1.6% of decedents were women; among women 25% were in the youngest age group, while among men only 4% were in the youngest group. Most decedents were enlisted personnel, and 60% served in the U.S. Army. Nearly 61% had a disability rating of &gt;50% and for the middle age group 54% had a disability rating of 100%. The most common service-connected conditions were tinnitus, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the oldest group, nearly half of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions and &lt;2% were due to external causes. In the youngest group, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for about 1/3 of deaths, whereas external causes or deaths due to accidents, suicide, or assault accounted for nearly 33% of deaths. For Veterans with service-connected PTSD or major depression; 6.5% of deaths were due to external causes whereas for Veterans without these conditions, only 3.1% were due to external causes.The finding of premature death due to external causes in the youngest age group as well as the finding of higher proportions of external causes in those with PTSD or major depression should be of great concern to those who care for Veterans." />

    <field content="Abstract：Drawing on the &quot;Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH community in South Africa&quot; (HAALSI) baseline survey, we present data on older adults' social networks and receipt of social support in rural South Africa. We examine how age and gender differences in social network characteristics matched with patterns predicted by theories of choice- and constraint-based network contraction in older adults.We used regression analysis on data for 5,059 South African adults aged 40 and older.Older respondents reported fewer important social contacts and less frequent communication than their middle-aged peers, largely due to fewer nonkin connections. Network size difference between older and younger respondents was greater for women than for men. These gender and age differences were explicable by much higher levels of widowhood among older women compared to younger women and older men. There was no evidence for employment-related network contraction or selective retention of emotionally supportive ties.Marriage-related structural constraints impacted on older women's social networks in rural South Africa, but did not explain choice-based network contraction. These findings suggest that many older women in rural Africa, a growing population, may have an unmet need for social support." />

    <field content="Abstract：This study primarily examines the associations between histories of childhood maltreatment (i.e., neglect, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse) and elder abuse victimization and explores whether gender moderates the associations.We conducted a secondary data analysis of 5,968 older adults (mean age = 71 years) based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (2010-2011). Using retrospective self-reports of childhood and current (past 12 months) victimization experiences, logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of early-life adversities on the likelihood of elder abuse victimization.Results indicate that childhood emotional abuse and childhood sexual abuse were associated with greater risk of being abused as older adults, after controlling for childhood and adult background factors. We also found that the effect of childhood sexual abuse on elder abuse victimization was weaker for women than men.Findings suggest that the phenomenon of revictimization may occur not only in early and middle adulthood, but also in late life. To advance our understanding of victimization across the life course, future research on root causes of elder abuse should include histories of child abuse." />

    <field content="Abstract：This study aimed to determine the outcome of neonates born to women with preeclampsia at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI).This was a retrospective descriptive study looking at the outcome of all babies born to women with preeclampsia and control babies born to normotensive women at the UHWI over a 20-month period. Maternal and neonatal demographic data and course of admission for admitted neonates were recorded. Descriptive analyses were performed.Neonates born to women with preeclampsia were more likely to be low birth weight [odds ratio (OR = 2.8; confidence interval (CI): 2.2-3.5], small for gestational age (OR = 2.3; CI: 1.9-2.9) or premature (OR = 2.5; CI: 2.0-3.0). They had a lower mean 5 min Apgar score than babies born to normotensive women p&lt;0.05. They were also more likely to be admitted to the neonatal unit 67 (59%) compared with neonates of normotensive women 13 (13%) p&lt;0.001. The main reason for admission was prematurity. Eighteen neonates, all born to women with preeclampsia, died, and the main cause of death was prematurity.Adverse neonatal outcome was noted in neonates born to women with preeclampsia, and this was predominantly related to prematurity and its complications." />

    <field content="Abstract：Although the increase in the number of centenarians is well documented today in countries with advanced demographic data, the same is not true for those aged 105 and over. The first aim of this paper, was to analyze the demographic characteristics of the 4,626 validated semi-super and 102 supercentenarians for the cohorts born between 1896 and 1910, referring to Italian Semi-Supercentenarians Survey (SSC). Then, starting from this data and from the survival  histories  in old ages - reconstructed by Vincent's Extinct - Cohort Method - for the cohorts born between 1870 and 1904, the most important aim was to analyze longevity history and the trend of gender gap of the Italian oldest cohorts beyond 100 years old.  The Italian centenarians and semi-supercentenarians increase from the first to the last cohort is due to the survival rise in old ages and the increase in the gender gap at extreme ages depends on the higher survival of women than men after 60 years old. Around 110-112 for both genders (for women in particular) a kind of resistance to further progress seems to appear in our analysis as in more recent studies on supercentenarians." />

    <field content="Abstract：Foot drill is a key component of military training and is characterized by frequent heel stamping, likely resulting in high tibial shock magnitudes. Higher tibial shock during running has previously been associated with risk of lower limb stress fractures, which are prevalent among military populations. Quantification of tibial shock during drill training is, therefore, warranted. This study aimed to provide estimates of tibial shock during military drill in British Army Basic training. The study also aimed to compare values between men and women, and to identify any differences between the first and final sessions of training.Tibial accelerometers were secured on the right medial, distal shank of 10 British Army recruits (n = 5 men; n = 5 women) throughout a scheduled drill training session in week 1 and week 12 of basic military training. Peak positive accelerations, the average magnitude above given thresholds, and the rate at which each threshold was exceeded were quantified.Mean (SD) peak positive acceleration was 20.8 (2.2) g across all sessions, which is considerably higher than values typically observed during high impact physical activity. Magnitudes of tibial shock were higher in men than women, and higher in week 12 compared with week 1 of training.This study provides the first estimates of tibial shock magnitude during military drill training in the field. The high values suggest that military drill is a demanding activity and this should be considered when developing and evaluating military training programs. Further exploration is required to understand the response of the lower limb to military drill training and the etiology of these responses in the development of lower limb stress fractures." />

    <field content="Abstract：Women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) suffer from reduced fertility, cardiovascular events and osteoporosis. Though differential microRNA (miRNA) expression has been described in several ovarian disorders, little is known about the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of DOR.Identify differentially expressed miRNAs in DOR and explore the role of miR-106a in human granulosa cell proliferation.MiRNA microarray (n=3) and RT-qPCR (n=30) were used to examine miRNA expression in serum and granulosa cells from normal cycling and DOR women. Primary human granulosa cells were treated alone or in combination with miR-106a mimic, miR-106a inhibitor, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) siRNA or p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) prior to assessment of cell viability and apoptosis. Western blot was used to measure ASK1 protein and phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAPK. Binding of miR-106a to ASK1 mRNA was examined by 3'UTR luciferase analysis.15 miRNAs were differentially expressed (n=30) and miR-106a was down-regulated in serum and granulosa cells of DOR women. MiR-106a mimic increased cell viability and attenuated apoptosis, whereas the converse occurred following treatment with miR-106a inhibitor. MiR-106a suppressed ASK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'UTR. MiR-106a inhibitor increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation/activation, and this effect was abolished by treatment with ASK1 siRNA. Whereas knockdown of ASK1 abolished the effects of miR-106a inhibitor on cell viability/apoptosis, pre-treatment with SB203580 did not significantly alter the effects of miR-106a inhibitor.Down-regulation of miR-106a may contribute to the pathogenesis of DOR by reducing granulosa cell viability and promoting apoptosis via enhanced ASK1 signaling." />

    <field content="Abstract：Thyroid nodules, adenomas, and goiter have consistently been associated with thyroid cancer risk. Few studies have assessed whether thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity influence this risk.To examine thyroid cancer risk following diagnoses of a wide range of benign thyroid conditions.Hospital and cancer registry linkage cohort study for the years 1978-2013.Nationwide (Denmark).Patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (n=85,169), hypothyroidism (n=63,143), thyroiditis (n=12,532), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=65,782), simple goiter (n=11,582), other/unspecified goiter (n=21,953), or adenoma (n=6,481) among 8,258,807 residents of Denmark during the study period.We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for differentiated thyroid cancer, excluding the first 12 months of follow-up after benign thyroid disease diagnosis.SIRs were significantly elevated for all benign thyroid diseases apart from hypothyroidism. SIRs were higher for men than women and in the earlier follow-up periods. Elevated SIRs were observed for localized and regional/distant thyroid cancer. After excluding the first 10 years of follow-up, hyperthyroidism (n=27 thyroid cancer cases, SIR=2.00, 95% CI 1.32-2.92), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=83, SIR=4.91, 95% CI 3.91-6.09), simple goiter (n=8, SIR=4.33, 95% CI 1.87-8.53), other/unspecified goiter (n=20, SIR=3.94, 95% CI 2.40-6.08), and adenoma (n=9, SIR=6.02, 95% CI 2.76-11.5) remained positively associated with thyroid cancer risk.We found an unexpected increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer, including regional/distant disease, following diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis that could not be solely attributed to increased medical surveillance. Hypothyroidism was less clearly associated with thyroid cancer risk." />

    <field content="Abstract：Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes.We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1-5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM; and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations.The established circadian rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits during and after pregnancy were longitudinally collected.The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes.We found women carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-h OGTT glucose: 0.36, 0.20, and -0.19 mmol/L per additional copy of the shorter sleep duration related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (p for interaction=0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mmol/L, though the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginally significant (p for interaction= 0.067).Our findings suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythm-related MTNR1B genetic variant on long term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM." />

    <field content="Abstract：Our prior meta-analyses demonstrated an increased prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but with substantial clinical heterogeneity.We aimed to update our previous review to quantify the prevalence of IGT and T2DM in PCOS with only quality studies (good and fair quality). We also aimed to examine the contribution of parameters including ethnicity, obesity and method of diagnosing T2DM in explaining the observed heterogeneity in IGT and T2DM prevalence in PCOS.We conducted a literature search (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, clinical trial registries and hand-searching) up to June 2016 to identify studies reporting the prevalence of dysglycemia (IGT and T2DM) in women with and without PCOS. We included studies where women with PCOS (defined according to original National Institute of Health) were compared to women without PCOS for the end-points of the prevalence of IGT or T2DM. We excluded case reports, case series, editorials, and narrative reviews. Studies where PCOS was diagnosed by self-report, or where IGT or T2DM were measured by fasting glucose, only were excluded. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using a priori criteria based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scaling (NOS) for non-randomized studies. Data are presented as odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) with random-effects meta-analysis by Mantel-Haenszel methods. We assessed the contribution of demographic and clinical factors to heterogeneity using subgroup and meta-regression analysis.We reviewed 4530 studies and included 40 eligible studies in the final analysis. On meta-analysis of quality studies, women with PCOS had an increased prevalence of IGT (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 2.17-4.90) and T2DM (OR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.44-5.72), which differed by ethnicity (for IGT, Asia: 5-fold, the Americas: 4-fold and Europe: 3-fold), was higher with obesity, and doubled among studies using self-report or administrative data for diagnosing diabetes. The ethnicity-related difference retained its significance for Asia and Europe in BMI-matched subgroups. Clear contributors to heterogeneity did not emerge in meta-regression.Our findings underscore the importance of PCOS as a cause of dysglycemia with a higher prevalence of IGT and T2DM. They support the relevance of ethnicity and obesity and emphasize the need for accurate diagnostic methods for diabetes.CRD42017056524." />

    <field content="Abstract：Integrated models of HIV/AIDS service delivery are believed to have advantages over stand-alone models of care from health planners' and providers' perspectives. Integration models differ, yet there is little information about the influence of differing models on workers' beliefs about models' efficacy. Here, we examine the effect of integration of HIV care into the general health system in India. In 2014, India replaced its stand-alone model of HIV service delivery-Community Care Centers (CCCs)-with a purported integrated model that delivers HIV medical services at general hospitals and HIV psychosocial services at nearby Care and Support Centers (CSCs). We examine 15 health workers' perceptions of how change from the earlier stand-alone model to the current model impacted women's care in a district in Uttar Pradesh, India. Results indicate that (1) Women's antiretroviral (ART) adherence and utilization of psychosocial support service for HIV/AIDS suffered when services were not provided at one site; (2) Provision of inpatient care in the CCC model offered women living in poverty personal safety in accessing HIV health services and promoted chances of competent ART usage and repeat service utilization; and (3) Although integration of HIV services with the general health system was perceived to improve patient anonymity and decrease chances of HIV-related stigma and discrimination, resource shortages continued to plague the integrated system while shifting costs of time and money to the patients. Findings suggest that integration efforts need to consider the context of service provision and the gendered nature of access to HIV care." />

    <field content="Abstract：The long-term effects of military deployment on the mental health of war veterans have been investigated extensively, but few studies have examined the long-term impact of parental deployment on children's mental health.Using a retrospective, multigenerational survey and propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects and endogeneity bias, we investigated the impact of parental deployment on the mental health of the adult children of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. We analysed data from 1966 adult men (35%) and women (65%) whose fathers (N = 1418) were selected at random from the population of surviving men who served in the Australian army during the Vietnam War (1962-75). Mean age of respondents was 37. The main outcome measures were self-reported diagnosis or treatment for anxiety and depression (i.e. lifetime and previous 12 months), suicidality based on Psychiatric Symptom Frequency Scale, and current mental health as measured by the Mental Health Inventory of the SF-36. The key independent variable was whether their fathers were deployed to the Vietnam War.Almost 40 years after the war, the adult children of deployed veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.28] and depression (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.03, 3.05), to have had thoughts of suicide and self-harm (OR = 2.39, CI = 1.57, 3.65) and to have made suicidal plans (OR = 3.52, CI = 1.40, 8.85) than the offspring of comparable, non-deployed army veterans. They also reported poorer current mental health (Coefficient = -5.08, CI = -6.60 - -3.56).The results imply that there are significant and enduring adverse effects of parental deployment on the mental health of children in military families, and provide some insight into the potential long-term impacts of recent military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq." />
